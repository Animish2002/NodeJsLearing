1.) WHAT IS NODE.JS?
node js gives us a run time environment to runn our code outside of the web-browser and it 
helps in writting server side code enabling the creation of dynamic web server applications 
and other server-side software.

2.) TO RUN A JS CODE IN TERMINAL {node file_name}
3.) THINGS WHICH ARE NOT REQUIRED AND WHICH ARR RELATED TO DOM manipulation are not in node.js

4.) CONTAINS Crypto graphy , file handling etc are removed

5.)npm init: npm intialize (makes a template file that helps to run over file/project)a config file

6.)WHAT IS MODULES?
=>divide the entire code base into small small modules it is moduler programming

to  import modules or code from other page we use { require("file_directory and name") } ////important

to export modules or code from current page we use { module.exports = "fun name" } /////important

module.exports={funtions}

exports.add = (a,b) => a+b;
export.sub = (a,b) => a-b;

same but it is an anonymous function that is been used

common js modules => (cjs) module.export and require(), by default add in nodejs projects ,older way
ES modules => (mjs) used in react , new way  
 

Imp
1. cjs runs in strict mode which means we cannot define
    variables without declaring them first

2. mjs code runs in non-strict mode variable without using var , let , or
    const , and the code will execute without throwing an error

3. module.exports is an empty object by default
