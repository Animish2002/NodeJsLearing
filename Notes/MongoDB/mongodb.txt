MongoDB is a NoSQL database

stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with hierarchical data

How it Works
Document-Oriented: Data is stored in documents within collections (similar to rows in tables).
Schema-less: Each document can have a different structure.
Scalable: Designed to scale out across many servers.

Some Basic commands 

Connecting to MongoDB => mongo
Show Databases => show dbs
Switch to a Database => use database_name
Show Collections => show collections



Insert a Document => db.collection_name.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 25 })

Find Documents => db.collection_name.find()

Update a Document => db.collection_name.updateOne(
    { name: "Alice" },
    { $set: { age: 26 } }
)

Delete a Document => db.collection_name.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" })
