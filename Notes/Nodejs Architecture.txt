Thread Pool => key component of the libuv library,uses to handle asynchronous operations

hread Pool
Definition:=> The thread pool is a collection of worker threads 
managed by libuv that perform asynchronous tasks in the background.

Purpose:=> It allows Node.js to perform potentially blocking operations 
asynchronously, without blocking the main event loop.

Size:=> By default, the thread pool has a size of 4 threads, but this 
can be configured via the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable.

Operations Handled by the Thread Pool
File System Operations: Reading, writing, and other file system interactions.
DNS Lookups: Resolving domain names.
Compression: Operations such as zlib compression.
Cryptographic Operations: Tasks like hashing and encryption.
User-defined Tasks: Custom tasks that are offloaded to the thread pool using libraries like worker_threads.
