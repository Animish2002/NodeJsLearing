Steps to Create API Endpoints (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE) in Node.js
1. Create a Schema:
Define the structure and data types of the data you will be sending or receiving.

2. Create a Model:
Create a model based on the schema to interact with the database.

3. Create Routes:
Define the API endpoints and the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the resource.

4. Create Controller Functions:
Define the functions that will handle the logic for each route.

5. Add Routes to the Main File:
Integrate the routes into the main application file to make them accessible.
