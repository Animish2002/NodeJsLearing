Model-View-Controller=> design pattern for software projects.


Components:

Model:

- Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
- Manages data, logic, and rules of the application.
- Example: Database schemas, business rules, data validation.

View:

- Represents the UI (User Interface) of the application.
- Displays data from the Model to the user and sends user commands to the Controller.
- Example: HTML, CSS, templates.

Controller:

- Acts as an intermediary between Model and View.
- Processes user input from the View, manipulates the Model, and updates the View.
- Example: Routes, HTTP request handling.

Workflow:

1. User interacts with the View.
2. Controller handles the user input and invokes Model changes.
3. Model updates based on Controller logic.
4. View updates based on Model changes and presents the updated data to the user.
