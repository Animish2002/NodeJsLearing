what we did in this code is that we decided a basic flow

where

first we accquired express then

✅1st connect mongo db => here for the connection.js file just did connection to the url thats it

✅2nd initialize middlewares => created index.js file where we imported fs module and there we are appending the file with the ip,req made method , url for the log file

✅3rd initialize routes => created i base route /api/users/ after users pe req jayega  
created a routes page named user.js where imported the handle functions for different crud operations for different urls like "/" for get all and post from user.js controller
 and "/:id" for patch , delete, getByid
