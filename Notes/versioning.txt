Versioning is the practice of giving unique names or numbers to 
different software versions. This helps identify each state of 
the software

example: "major.minor.patch" 
4.18.2

1st=> 4
2nd=> 18
3rd=> 2

//3rdd part (Last part) = Minor Fixes (Optional)
Latest -> 4.18.5

//2nd part (middle part) = Recommended Bug Fix (Security Update)

//3rd part () = Major Release (Breaking Update) 
show not add to the existing code with different version

^ this symbol => (carat symbol) this means that dont change the major verion 4 but can update 18.2 versions
it will auto update last and middle updates as availbl

~ this means i want to change any versions for major
~4.18.1 ok
~4.18.2 ok
~4.18.3 ok

~4.19.0 not ok
